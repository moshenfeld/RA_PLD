# Implementation Overview

This document describes the internal structure of `PLD_accounting` and how the implementation maps to the paper's random-allocation setting.

For user-facing examples, see [README.md](README.md) and [usage_example.py](usage_example.py).

## Paper-Aligned Semantics

The package follows the `k`-out-of-`t` random-allocation language:

- In each epoch, a record participates in `k` selected steps out of `t` total steps.
- This is repeated for `num_epochs` epochs.

API parameter mapping:

- `num_steps = t`
- `num_selected = k`
- `num_epochs = number of epochs`

In code, this decomposition is implemented in
`allocation_PMF()` in `PLD_accounting/random_allocation_accounting.py`:

- Floor component:
  - `floor_steps = floor(num_steps / num_selected)`
  - `remainder = num_steps - num_selected * floor_steps`
  - `floor_epochs = (num_selected - remainder) * num_epochs`
- Ceil component (only when `remainder > 0`):
  - `ceil_steps = floor_steps + 1`
  - `ceil_epochs = remainder * num_epochs`

Both Gaussian and realization paths use the same floor/ceil decomposition and
compose both components when needed.

Input validation in `allocation_PMF()`:

- `num_steps`, `num_selected`, and `num_epochs` must be at least `1`.
- `num_steps` must be at least `num_selected` to ensure at least one
  per-selection step.

## High-Level Pipeline

1. Public API validates inputs and builds PMFs for REMOVE and ADD directions.
2. Per-round random-allocation PMFs are computed in loss-space via exp-space convolution helpers.
3. Floor/ceil PMF components are composed across their epoch counts and
   combined when both are present.
4. Final PMFs are converted to `dp_accounting.PrivacyLossDistribution`.
5. Epsilon/delta queries are answered on that PLD object.

Both input modes share this shape:

- Gaussian mode: starts from analytic log-normal factors.
- Realization mode: starts from user-provided `PLDRealization`.

## Parameter Budget Conventions

Shared composition budgets are derived inside
`_allocation_PMF_core()` in `PLD_accounting/random_allocation_accounting.py`.

- `output_tail_truncation = component_tail_truncation / 3`
- `base_tail_truncation = output_tail_truncation / (2 * component_num_epochs)`
- `output_loss_discretization = config.loss_discretization / 3`
- `base_loss_discretization = output_loss_discretization / sqrt(component_num_epochs)`

Interpretation used in code:

- `allocation_PMF()` splits the direction-level tail budget by `1/2` before
  passing it into floor/ceil component construction and optional floor/ceil
  merge convolution.
- `/3` is used in each component core because truncation is handled across
  multiple stages (base creation, composition, output alignment).
- `1 / (2 * num_epochs)` is used for base tail truncation in each component.
- `1 / sqrt(num_epochs)` is used for core loss discretization because
  discretization error scales approximately like the square root of the number
  of compositions.
- In shared geometric remove/add base builders, one-step factor creation gets
  an additional `1 / num_steps` tail scaling to keep per-step discretization
  budgets stable as inner step count grows.

Gaussian FFT path needs additional one-step parameters for discretizing analytic
continuous factors. These are derived in
`_gaussian_allocation_fft()` in `PLD_accounting/random_allocation_gaussian.py`:

- `single_step_tail_truncation = tail_truncation / num_steps`
  with a numerical-stability floor (`eps * 1e-10`) chosen empirically as a
  reasonable value (no strict derivation).
- Per-factor FFT tail allocation:
  REMOVE uses `single_step_tail_truncation / 2` (lower + upper factors),
  ADD uses no extra split.

Gaussian GEOM path now mirrors realization wiring after factor creation:
- both routes call shared `geometric_allocation_PMF_base_add/remove(...)`;
- only the base distribution creation differs (analytic Gaussian vs explicit realization).

Realization path uses the same depth factor for component-level loss
discretization before shared composition finalization.

## Public API Surface

Defined in `PLD_accounting/random_allocation_api.py`:

- Gaussian path:
  - `gaussian_allocation_PLD(...)`
  - `gaussian_allocation_epsilon_extended(...)`
  - `gaussian_allocation_delta_extended(...)`
  - `gaussian_allocation_epsilon_range(...)`
  - `gaussian_allocation_delta_range(...)`
- Realization path:
  - `general_allocation_PLD(...)`
  - `general_allocation_epsilon(...)`
  - `general_allocation_delta(...)`

Notes:

- PLD builders reject `BoundType.BOTH`; users build separate DOMINATES and IS_DOMINATED PLDs.
- Realization-based allocation requires `ConvolutionMethod.GEOM`.

## Core Composition Modules

### `random_allocation_accounting.py`

This is the shared composition core used by both Gaussian and realization accounting.

Key functions:

- `allocation_PLD(...)`:
  Shared top-level orchestrator used by both API paths. Calls
  `allocation_PMF(...)` for REMOVE and ADD, then combines with
  `_compose_pld_from_pmfs(...)`.
- `_allocation_PMF_core(...)`:
  Calls a base-PMF callback, regrids to core resolution, composes across
  epochs, then regrids to output discretization.
- `geometric_allocation_PMF_base_remove(...)`:
  Shared exp-space geometric composer for REMOVE. Accepts a callback that
  builds lower/upper loss factors.
- `geometric_allocation_PMF_base_add(...)`:
  Shared exp-space geometric composer for ADD. Accepts a callback that builds
  the add loss factor.
- `allocation_PMF(...)`:
  Applies adaptive step decomposition and composes floor/ceil components.
- `_compose_pld_from_pmfs(...)`:
  Converts internal PMFs into a `dp_accounting` PLD object.

### `random_allocation_realization.py`

Realization-specific path that starts from explicit `PLDRealization` factors and
then reuses shared composition logic.

Key functions:

- `realization_remove_base_distributions(...)`: prepares REMOVE realization
  base/dual loss factors for shared geometric composition.
- `realization_add_base_distribution(...)`: prepares ADD realization base
  factor for shared geometric composition.

### `random_allocation_gaussian.py`

Gaussian-specific path that constructs factors analytically, then reuses shared composition logic.

Key functions:

- `gaussian_allocation_PMF_core(...)`: selects FFT/GEOM/BEST computation and
  returns the base PMF used by `_allocation_PMF_core(...)`:
  - FFT callback uses `_gaussian_allocation_fft(...)` with compact ADD/REMOVE internals.
  - GEOM callback uses shared add/remove geometric cores with Gaussian factor
    builders, matching realization route structure.
  - BEST callback combines FFT and GEOM PMFs.
- Internal builders:
  - `_gaussian_allocation_fft_remove(...)`
  - `_gaussian_remove_geom_loss_factors(...)`
  - `_gaussian_allocation_fft_add(...)`
  - `_gaussian_add_geom_loss_factor(...)`

## Adaptive Refinement

`PLD_accounting/adaptive_random_allocation.py` computes upper/lower ranges by iteratively refining:

- `loss_discretization` (halved each step)
- `tail_truncation` (divided by 10 each step)

Entry points:

- `optimize_allocation_epsilon_range(...)`
- `optimize_allocation_delta_range(...)`

The module tracks best upper/lower bounds across iterations and returns `AdaptiveResult`.

## Subsampling Integration

`PLD_accounting/subsample_PLD.py` provides:

- `subsample_PLD(pld, sampling_probability)`
- `subsample_PMF(base_pld, sampling_prob, direction)`

This module implements PLD-based subsampling amplification (Appendix C mapping) and uses DOMINATES semantics.

## Numerical Invariants

Across the codebase:

- Infinity atoms (`p_neg_inf`, `p_pos_inf`) are represented explicitly.
- Mass conservation is enforced after discretization and convolution.
- Bound semantics are preserved during regridding/truncation:
  - `BoundType.DOMINATES` for upper bounds
  - `BoundType.IS_DOMINATED` for lower bounds
- Loss-space and exp-space transforms are explicit (`exp_linear_to_geometric`, `log_geometric_to_linear`).

## Practical Extension Points

- New mechanisms can be added by producing valid `PLDRealization` inputs and
  using `general_allocation_PLD(...)`.
- Gaussian method tuning is controlled by `AllocationSchemeConfig` and
  `ConvolutionMethod`.
- Additional accounting workflows can compose returned `dp_accounting` PLDs directly.
